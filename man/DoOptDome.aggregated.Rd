\title{Optimize with Aggregated Length Data}
\usage{
DoOptDome.aggregated(
  lifeHistoryObj,
  fixedFleetPars,
  LengthCompObj,
  SizeBins = NULL,
  Lc = 0,
  mod = c("GTG", "LBSPR")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lifeHistoryObj}{S4 life history object (same format as GTGDomeLBSPRSim2)}

\item{fixedFleetPars}{List of fixed fleet parameters including selectivity type}

\item{LengthCompObj}{S4 LengthComp object containing length composition data}

\item{SizeBins}{Optional list of size bin specifications with Linc and ToSize elements}

\item{Lc}{Length at first capture for removing small fish from analysis (default 0).
Only applies to fishery-independent data}

\item{mod}{Character string specifying model type ("GTG" or "LBSPR").
Currently only "GTG" is supported}
}
\value{
Same as DoOptDome() plus:
\itemize{
\item processed_data: Processed and pooled length composition data
\item original_n_groups: Number of groups in the original data before pooling
}
}
\description{
Convenience wrapper that always pools (aggregates) multiple groups before
optimization, regardless of the original data structure.
}
\details{
This function ensures data is always pooled before optimization by
calling processLengthCompData() with byGroup = FALSE. It's useful when the user
want to analyze combined data from multiple sources/years without having to
remember to set byGroup = FALSE.

[["utility-functions.html", "5 Utility functions", " 5 Utility functions 5.0.1 poolLengthComp function The poolLengthComp function pools length data when multiple columns exist. It sums length frequency data or concatenates length composition data as a single vector. 5.0.2 LoptFunc function The LoptFunc function calculates optimum harvest length. Derived from Beverton 1992, in a year-class subject to a moderate and constant exponential mortality and whose individuals are growing towards an asymptotic size (as in the Von Bertalanffy growth function), the total biomass of the year-class (i.e.Â the product of numbers and average weight) reaches a maximum value at some intermediate age (\\(Topt\\)) at a certain weight and length of the individual fish (\\(Wopt\\) and \\(Lopt\\), respectively). \\(Lopt\\) is calculated as: \\[ Lopt = 3 \\frac {L_{\\infty}}{(3 + M/K)} \\] This function is necessary for the PoptFunc function (proportion of fish within optimal sizes in the catch). 5.0.3 LcFunc function The LcFunc estimates length at full selectivity. This can be done in two methods: 1) using the mode of the length-frequency distribution (LFD); or 2) applying a Kernel smoother to the LFD. For calculating the mode of the LFD, the cumulative distribution of the LFD is computed, and a loess smoother is applied to predict across equally spaced length intervals (1 cm interval); the length at which the cumulative distribution of the predictions increases the most (highest slope) corresponds to the mode of the LFD. Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution of an example predicted LFD, and the vertical line corresponds to the mode of the distribution. Figure 5.1: Cumulative length-frequency distribution The second method is to apply a Kernel smoother to the LFD and take its maximum value as the length at full selectivity. Figure 2 shows the length at which the Kernel smoother estimates highest density estimates. Figure 5.2: Kernel smoother applied to length-frequency distribution Some results from applying these two functions to example LFDs are presented below. The left hand plots show an example LFD, and the right-hand side plots show a subset of the example LFD, in order to test the functions with smaller sample sizes and more sparse data.
